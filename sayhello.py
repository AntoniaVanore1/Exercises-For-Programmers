# 1st Exercise is a variation on "Hello, World", except for the 
# addition of input.

# First, create your variable and get the input

name = input("What is your name? ")

# I'm assuming Python 3.7, if you are using 2, you need to 
# use raw_input() - input() in Python 2 attempts to evaluate the given
# data, while raw_input() will merely accept what the user types as a string
# Next, you need to print the message:

print("Hello, " + name + ", nice to meet you!")
