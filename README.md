# Exercises-For-Programmers

Hello fellow human :) 

This is my attempt at helping out others, while helping myself (of course).
My repo is a code-along using a book called "Exercises For Programmers" by 
Brian P. Hogan. Throughout my project, I am using Python3. I have included
tips in the comments for some of you who may be using Python2. Python3 is not
backwards compatible. When you call a program in version 3.7, you must 
use "Python3" to call up the correct interpreter.

Common Pitfalls in Python:

1. The Spacing Woes: Four spaces from the left is norm for margins in Python.
 If you are seeing "Syntax Error" and can't figure it out, you may have
 flubbed a space. Statements on the same level are grouped together.

2. Name? What name?: "Name Error" usually indicates you forgot to declare a 
variable, made a mistake in declaring a variable, messed up the scope of the 
variable, or you maybe mispelled something. It happens.

3. You're not my type: "Type Error" indicates you are applying the wrong kind
of data to a fuction. For example "Bob"/"Sue" would return a type error as
you cannot perform mathematical operations on strings.

I'll add to this as it comes up.

Tips:
DO THE STUFF YOURSELF FIRST! You can't learn if you don't try to do it on 
your own first.
Know when to walk away - Sometimes you should take a break when you can't
solve the problem. Breathe for a bit and come back to it. 
Google is your friend in this endeavor.
